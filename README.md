# MTG-Deck-Randomizer

A multi-use program I use to pick which EDH deck I want to play.

If you're like me (stupid, bored, and obsessed with MTG), then you probably have a ton of EDH Commander decks. I built this program to help me decide which EDH deck to play when I can't make up my mind!

This program can also serve as a general-purpose randomizer with a few adjustments to the source code.

## Setup

To use this program:

1. Place the `MTG` folder in the `Apps` folder of your Flipper Zero.
2. Edit the included `.txt` file with the names of your decks.
   
You can also add or edit deck names directly on the Flipper Zero:

- Press the **Down** button to open the list of decks.
- At the bottom of the list, select "Add New Deck" to add a new entry.
- Hover over any deck name and hold the **OK** button to edit or delete an entry.

Once your deck list is set up, open the app and press **OK**. The app will display a quick animation before revealing the randomly selected deck!

## Conclusion

I'm currently working on other projects, so if there are any issues, they may not get fixed immediately. Sorry in advance!
