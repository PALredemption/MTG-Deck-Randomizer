# MTG-Deck-Randomizer
A multi-use program that I use to pick which EDH deck I want to play. 

If you are like me (stupid, bored, and obssessed with MTG). Then you probably have a ton of EDH Commander decks. 

I built this program to help me choose which EDH deck Ill play when I can't decide

This program can also be used as a general purpose randomizer. It just requires a little tinkering of the source code. 

#Setup

To use this program, all you have to do is place the "MTG" folder in the "Apps" folder of your flipper

Then, edit the txt file included with the names of your decks.

You can also add or edit deck names from the flipper itself. Simply press the down button to open up the list of decks. At the bottom of the list is an "Add New Deck" option. Otherwise, you can hover over a deck name and hold the "OK" button to either edit or delete an entry.

Once you have your Decklist setup, simply open the app and click "OK". The app will run through a little animation before showing you the deck it has selected. 

#Conclusion

I am working on other projects right now so If there are issues, They may not get fixed. Sorry!
